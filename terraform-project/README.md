## File Descriptions

- **backend.tf**: Configures the backend for storing the Terraform state. It specifies the backend type and any necessary configuration options.

- **provider.tf**: Defines the providers that Terraform will use to manage resources, specifying the provider configurations (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

- **main.tf**: The main configuration file where the resources are defined. It includes the infrastructure components that Terraform will create and manage.

- **variables.tf**: Declares the input variables for the Terraform configuration, specifying variable names, types, and default values.

- **outputs.tf**: Defines the output values that Terraform will return after applying the configuration, specifying outputs that can be used in other configurations or displayed to the user.

## Modules

- **modules/vpc/**: Contains the Terraform module for creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), including its own main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf files specific to VPC resources.

- **modules/eks/**: Contains the Terraform module for creating an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster, including its own main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf files specific to EKS resources.

- **modules/ecs/**: Contains the Terraform module for creating an Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster, including its own main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf files specific to ECS resources.

- **modules/rds/**: Contains the Terraform module for creating a Relational Database Service (RDS) instance, including its own main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf files specific to RDS resources.

- **modules/iam/**: Contains the Terraform module for managing Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies, including its own main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf files specific to IAM resources.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Terraform installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository or download the project files.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Initialize the Terraform configuration by running:
   ```
   terraform init
   ```
5. Review the planned actions by running:
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```
6. Apply the configuration to create the resources:
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

## Usage
